# CryptoDataToCSV

## Project still in progress!
Save minute, hourly, and daily cryptocurrency data to a CSV file. Powered by the CryptoCompare API.
Uses a modified version of the [cryCompare](https://github.com/stefs304/cryCompare) Python wrapper for the CryptoCompare API.

cryptodatatocsv.py functions take the JSON responses returned by the CryptoCompare API and save them to appropriately named .csv files.
I am planning to use the data from this project to explore deep learning applications in cryptocurrency trading.
